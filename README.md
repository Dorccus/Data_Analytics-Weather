# Weather Dashboard Data Analysis and Storytelling in Power BI.

## Project Overview
This project explores hourly weather data from January 2012, focusing on temperature, humidity, visibility, 
wind speed and atmospheric conditions.
Built using Power BI, the dashboard transforms raw meteorological data into compelling insights 
through visualisation and storytelling.

## Objectives
Clean and transform weather data using Power Query.
Create interactive visuals to uncover seasonal and hourly patterns.
Identify the most frequent weather conditions per season.
Extract correlations between metrics such as wind speed and visibility.
Practice dynamic dashboard design and data storytelling.

## Tools and Skills
Power BI: Data modelling, dashboard design, KPI creation.
Power Query: For data cleaning, column transformations, and type formatting.
DAX: Custom measures for seasonal analysis, condition frequency, and KPI extraction.
Storytelling through Data: Insights, summaries and thematic framing.

Temperature Line Chart: Tracks the weather by Avg Temp_C and sums the Wind_Speed km/h by Date.
Visibility Analysis: Identifies low-visibility zones linked to wind and rain.
Weather Condition Breakdown: Compares the frequency of fog, rain, and sunny days.
KPI Cards: Showcase max temperature, rainiest times/ hour and lowest visibility.
Slicers: Enable interactivity by filtering season, hour, or condition type.

## Key Insights
Johannesburg's summer mornings begin under thick fog, with visibility averaging below 6 km.
As midday approached, pressure dropped and wind speed increased, ushering in light rain and cloud cover.
Snow showers appeared later in the dataset, aligning with temperature dips and higher wind gusts.
